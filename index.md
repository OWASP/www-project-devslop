**Welcome to OWASP DevSlop - Sloppy DevOps!**

The OWASP DevSlop project contains several modules, all with the purpose of teaching participants about DevSecOps. 

##OWASP DevSlop Modules
DevSlop has different modules that make up the project. You can use one, some, or all of them. They are all maintained to function independantly of each other.

##Blog
OWASP DevSlop has a blog on [dev.to!](https://dev.to/devslop)

##Shows
This module is lead by Nancy Gariché.

We stream at least once a month on YouTube. You can find out when we stream by joining our [Meetup Group](https://devslop.co). You can catch the shows you’ve missed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/OWASP_DevSlop).
